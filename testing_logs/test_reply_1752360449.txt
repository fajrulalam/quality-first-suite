=== Gemini Response ===
The process for handling defects involves a three-pronged approach.  First, all defects are discussed before the end of each sprint in a meeting with Core team developers.  This review ensures the accuracy of defect information, including reason, classification, QA leakage, phase of discovery, resolution, and environment.  A Jira filter, "Ninja Core Defects," is used for monitoring. [SOP: Monitoring defects & production issues]  Second, production issues are discussed and planned every three weeks during pre-grooming sessions, prioritizing tickets for the upcoming sprint using the "Ninja Core Production Issues" filter. [SOP: Monitoring defects & production issues]  Finally, Jira is integrated with Slack to provide timely notifications of new defects or bugs, ensuring developer awareness, team visibility, and identification of misdirected Jira creation.
