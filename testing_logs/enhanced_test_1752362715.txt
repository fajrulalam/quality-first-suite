If you raise a defect and discover the issue also exists in production, you should follow these steps:

**Direct Answer:** Report the issue as a "Bug" with the environment set to "Production."  This differs from a "Defect," which is linked to a specific sprint story.

**Step-by-Step Procedure:**

1. **Identify the Issue Type:** Determine if the issue is related to a specific sprint story.  If it is *not* related to a sprint story, it should be reported as a "Bug." If it *is* related, it should be reported as a "Defect." **[SOP: Defects/Bugs Process]**

2. **Report the Issue:** Create a Jira ticket.  

    *   If the issue is *not* related to a sprint story, the Jira ticket type should be "Bug" with the "Environment" field set to "Production." **[SOP: Defects/Bugs Process]**
    *   If the issue *is* related to a sprint story, the Jira ticket type should be "Defect," and should be associated with the relevant sprint story. **[SOP: Defects/Bugs Process]**

3. **Additional Considerations:**  Ensure that all necessary information, such as steps to reproduce, screenshots, and affected users are included in the Jira report.  This aids in efficient resolution of the issue. **[SOP: Defects/Bugs Process]**


**Important Notes:**

*   The distinction between "Defect" and "Bug" is crucial for accurate tracking and resolution.  A "Defect" is a child Jira issue and is linked to a parent story. A "Bug" can be created independently. **[SOP: Defects/Bugs Process]**
*   The "Ninja Core Production Issues" filter can be used to monitor production issues.  These are discussed and prioritized every three weeks during pre-grooming. **[SOP: Monitoring defects & production issues]**

**Related Processes:**

* The "Ninja Core Defects" filter tracks defects within the QA cycle and is reviewed every three weeks before the end of the sprint. **[SOP: Monitoring defects & production issues]**
* Regular monitoring and reporting are key to reducing production issues and improving software quality.
